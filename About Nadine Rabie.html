                    <h2>Originally from Bethlehem, Palestine. Currently in Munich, Germany.</h2>
                    <p>Hey there, I'm Nadine - a user experience designer and human rights researcher on a mission to make the world a better place through design.

                        In a different chapter of my career, I worked in Human Rights advocating for the rights of marginalized communities and analyzing policies and practices that undermine those rights. While in that space, I observed how poorly-designed digital products prevented the reach of important historical and current affairs to the masses - the reach of which could instigate solidarity and eventually, change the world. 
                        
                        As I identified that my teamâ€™s research was falling between the cracks, I saw an opportunity to bridge the gap. That is when I stumbled upon information design and subsequently discovered the world of user experience design.
                        
                        Now, I am all about crafting digital experiences that are not only intuitive and seamless, but are impactful too. Armed with the skillset of a human rights researcher, I dive into understanding humans, empowering them to accomplish their goals by genuinely understanding their needs. 
                        
                        Outside of the design realm, you will find me engrossed in books, exploring new places, and soaking in everything about the human experience. 
                        
                        I am always down to connect with likeminded people. Reach out and let's together make the world a better place, one design at a time. </p>
