            <p>
              In a rapidly evolving digital landscape, young people often face
              the challenge of efficiently managing different financial
              activities with ease and minimal effort.

            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>
              I found that young consumers seeking control of their finances and
              effective cross-border money management are often frustrated when
              navigating multiple financial platforms for different tasks. The
              causes of these frustrations include: inefficient processes,
              limited time, complicated financial jargon, and absence of a
              holistic financial overview.

              PlutoPay addresses this challenge by providing a consolidated

                management.
              </p>
              <p>
                Importantly, by creating a visual story of these goals, I
                identified opportunities of development for PlutoPay, which

              3 major improvements: A more holistic approach to simplicity
            </h2>
            <p>
              After continuously iterating on my design in response to user
              feedback, I came up with 3 major improvements that maintained
              simplicity as a value while complementing it with assistance and
              guidance:

              <h3>Attaching saving goals to spending limits</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Initially, I considered discipline as the sole motivator for
                  users to spend less.
                </li>
                <li>
                  User feedback revealed that supplementing a spending limit
                  with a saving goal would incentivize users to stay within
                  their spending limit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Adding a CTA to create a saving goal after setting a spending
                  limit provides the ‘why’ for the latter.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  At first, I was concerned that reminders would reduce the
                  design’s simplicity, driving me to only add a notifications
                  button towards the end of the funnel.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Usability testing revealed that users benefit from reminders
                  about spending limits and saving goals.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Implementing reminders in the funnel itself ensures users stay
                  focused on their financial objectives.

                  Originally, I had a 'Recommended for You' section for
                  investments based on spending habits.
                </li>
                <li>
                  User feedback emphasized a preference for recommendations
                  derived from personally answered questions rather than an
                  opaque backend algorithm.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A questionnaire fosters a sense of control over users’
                  finances and is more personalized.

            <h2>What I learnt and would do differently next time</h2>
            <p>
              Beyond the tangible output of PlutoPay, the experience of applying
              an entire UX process to a product was highly informative. It has
              provided me with valuable insights and a clear direction on how to
              approach future UX projects. That being said, here are a few
              things I've learned:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Collecting continuous user feedback: While working on PlutoPay,
                I gathered user insights early on and conducted usability
                testing post first prototype. Yet, my process can be improved by
                maintaining a continuous feedback loop throughout development,
                such as implementing rounds of rapid prototyping, to address
                user needs upfront and minimize significant adjustments later
                on.
              </li>
              <li>
                Embracing iterative progress over perfection: I had the tendency
                to postpone PlutoPay’s product development in pursuit of a
                "perfect" solution, resulting in project delays. I have learned
                though, that instead of striving for perfection from the outset,
                prioritizing the delivery of a functional and valuable product
                in a timely manner is key. This allows for iterative progress
                and continuous refinement based on user feedback and evolving
                requirements, ultimately leading to better results.
              </li>
              <li>
                Prioritizing early organization of work files: On a more
                practical note, I overlooked the organization of my Figma file
                and layers initially, leading to the need for extensive edits
                towards the project's end, consuming valuable time. This has
                taught me the importance of diligently organizing the file and
                layers right from the beginning in future projects to establish
                a more seamless workflow.
